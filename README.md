## Project Info

This repository presents the analysis of Black Carbon data from India. Students and reasearchers from UBC have carried out a field campaign in India with an aim to understand the indoor air quality status in rural Indian households. We used micro-aethalometers, low-cost air quality sensor modules (RAMP) to monitor air pollutants in two villages. More details on the project outcomes and results will be shared in this repository.
