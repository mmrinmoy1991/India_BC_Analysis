# Introduction

## Motivation: Indoor Air Exposure

* Black Carbon, PM2.5 and CO are major pollutant from indoor emissions
* Prime Source of indoor emission is Cooking - using **Solid Biomass Fuel (SBF)**
* SBF use is common in LMICs like India, particularly the **rural households** (80% population)
* Cooking Emission can be as high as 20 times of the background concentration
* Factors that effect the exposure to indoor pollutants
  - Fuel usage in cooking
  - Type of cooking setup (oven type and kitchen type)
  - Household ventilation
  - Food choices and cooking time
* Primary emission reduction can be achieved by adopting clean fuels such as **LPG**
* However, affordability and fuel-stacking remains a big challenge
* Community and Household level **actionable measures** can be a solution to reduce exposure
* Very **limited** BC monitoring data from rural communities

## Black Carbon - Measurement Challanges

* BC is component of combustion derived particulate matter (PM)
* BC is a strong absorber of solar radiation, with 20 year GWP of **4470**
* BC has also been identified as a **toxic pollutant** - can impact human organ growth
* Monitoring BC is a big challenge
  - No particular chemical definition
  - BC/EC/Soot measurement techniques
    - **Aethalometer**: Real-time Light absorption measurement at 880nm
      - Real-time analysis
      - Correction schemes have been thoroughly studied and developed
      - Multi-wavelength light absorption data facilitates Source Apportionment of BC.
      - Artifacts: Scattering by particles, Loading effects on filter
    - **EC-OC Analyzer**: Thermal-optical technique
      - Semi real-time analysis on sampled aerosol filter
      - OC quantification
    - **Photo-Acoustic Measurement**: Optical characterization
      - Suspended aerosol particle
      - Free from loading effect
      - Measures aerosol light scattering
    - **Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2)**: Laser Induced Incandescence
      - High accuracy, sensitivity (in Femtograms) and rich dataset
      - Size range: 200-1500 nm
      - particle sizing capability
  - However, 
    - SP2, PAAS, EC-OC can be very expensive - not adoptable in certain situations
    - May not be suitable for **field deployment with limited logistics** (e.g. rural setup)
    - Aethalometers are **widely used** for regulatory grade BC measurement, ease of use.
    - Latest **micro-Aethalometer** can be a solution in field deployment

## Source Apportionment from Aethalometer Data

* Aethalometer Measurement Process:
  - light attenuation -> absorption coefficient $b_{abs}$ -> apply correction -> BC mass concentration
  - Source of uncertainty:
    - Loading correction scheme utilized 
    - Fixed scattering correction 
    - Use of fixed **Mass Absorption Cross Section (MAC)**
* Source Apportionment Process:
  - Majorly based on Absorption Angstrom Exponent (AAE): a quantity to measure the spectral dependence of light absorption by aerosols.
$$ b_{abs} = k \times \lambda^{-\alpha} $$
  - From a multi-wavelength aethelomater $\alpha$ can be derived from log-linear regression fit between $b_{abs}$ and $\lambda$ (wavelength)

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.cap= "Sample AAE Estimation"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Graphic/babs_AE33_01.jpg"))
```    
  
  - **Sandradewi 2008** -> Aethalometer Model
    - Two component based apportionment : Fossil Fuel (FF) and Biomass Burning (BB)
$$ b_{abs}(\lambda) = b_{abs,FF}(\lambda) + b_{abs,BB}(\lambda) $$    
    - Uses fixed $\alpha$ values for FF ($\alpha_{FF}$) and BB ($\alpha_{BB}$) to segregate the light absorption component

## Pollutant Summary Statisics

Here I am focusing on the combustion generated pollutants, i.e. PM2.5, BC and CO. The mean concentration and coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean) have been calculated and presented for indoor and outdoor in village 1 and 2. 
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
HH_3 %>% select(House, PM2.5, CO, BC) %>% 
  group_by(House) %>% 
    summarise(meanPM2.5 = mean(PM2.5,na.rm=TRUE),
              covPM2.5 = sd(PM2.5, na.rm = TRUE)/meanPM2.5,
              meanBC = mean(BC,na.rm=TRUE),
              covBC = sd(BC, na.rm = TRUE)/meanBC,
              meanCO = mean(CO,na.rm=TRUE),
              covCO = sd(CO, na.rm = TRUE)/meanCO) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2) %>% 
  kable_styling()
```


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
HH_3 %>% 
  group_by(House) %>% 
  get_summary_stats(c(BC,PM2.5,CO), type = "mean_sd") %>% 
  arrange(variable)

```


Note: PM2.5 and BC are in $\mu g/m^3$; CO in *ppb*

* Summary stat does not reflect difference - proposed 
Hypothesis generating: 

* Range and variability in household - ventilation
* BC is local not PM2.5 - we are more confident




## Analysis of BC concentration

Making a new data set for analysis

```{r}
HH_4 = HH_3 %>% 
  separate(House, into = c("Village","Position"), sep = "_", remove = FALSE) %>%
  select(House,Village, Position, date, dDate, hour, PM2.5, BC, BCbb, BCff, AAE_Blue_IR, DayType, DayPart, activity)
```


### Days of Sampling
```{r}
HH_4 %>% group_by(Village,activity) %>% 
  summarise(n = n_distinct(dDate))
```


### Indoor to Indoor Correlation

### Indoor to Outdoor Correlation

### Outdoor to Outdoor Correlations

### All correaltion

```{r}

hourlyBC = HH_4 %>% select(House, hour, activity, BC) %>% 
  group_by(hour, House, activity)%>% 
  summarise(meanBC = mean(BC, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "House", values_from = "meanBC")

my_cols <- c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07")  
pairs(hourlyBC[,3:6], pch = 19,  cex = 0.5,
      col = my_cols[hourlyBC$activity],
      lower.panel=NULL)

pairs.panels(hourlyBC[,3:6],
             method = "pearson", # correlation method
             hist.col = "#00AFBB",
             density = TRUE,  # show density plots
             ellipses = TRUE # show correlation ellipses
              )

```



```{r}
HH_4 %>% group_by(Village, Position, hour) %>%
  select(hour, Village, Position, BC, activity) %>% 
  mutate(row = row_number()) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "Position", values_from = "BC") %>% 
  mutate(IO_BC = Indoor/Outdoor) %>% 
  group_by(hour, Village, activity) %>% 
  summarise(meanIO = mean(IO_BC, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(.,aes(x = hour, y = meanIO, group = Village, color = Village))+
  geom_point()

HH_4 %>% group_by(Village, Position, hour) %>% 
  get_summary_stats(c(BC,BCbb, BCff), type = "mean_sd") %>% 
  ggplot(.,aes(x = hour, y = mean, fill= variable))+
  geom_area()+
  facet_grid(Village~Position)


HH_4 %>% group_by(Village, Position, hour) %>% 
  get_summary_stats(c(BC,BCbb, BCff, PM2.5), type = "mean_sd") %>% 
  mutate(row = row_number()) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "Position", values_from = c("mean","sd"))%>% 
  ggplot(.,aes(x = hour, y = mean_Indoor, group = Village, color = Village))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~variable, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y")
  

```

### Statistical Analysis

Concentration During Cooking Period
```{r}

HH_4 %>% 
  timeVariation(.,pollutant = "BC", group = "Position")



```

```{r}
HH_3 %>% 
  group_by(House) %>% 
  summarise(minBC = min(BC),
            maxBC = max(BC),
            avgBC = mean(BC),
            sdBC = sd(BC))
```


```{r}
HH_3 %>% 
  ggplot(.,aes(x = BC))+
  geom_density()+
  facet_grid(House~activity)

HH_3 %>% 
  ggplot(.,aes(x = date, y = BC))+
  geom_point()

HH_3 %>% 
  filter(BC<1) %>% 
  ggplot(.,aes(x = BC))+
  geom_histogram()+
  facet_grid(House~DayPart)

HH_3 %>% filter(BC>0.2) %>% 
  ggplot(.,aes(y = House, x = BC))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_grid(~activity)

HH_3 %>% filter(BC>0.3) %>% 
  group_by(House) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), 
            day = n_distinct(dDate))

HH_3 %>% filter(BC<0.4) %>% 
  ggplot(.,aes(x = date, y = T))+
  geom_point()

HH_3 %>% filter(BC>0.4) %>% 
  select(hour, activity, House, BC) %>% 
  mutate(row = row_number()) %>% 
  separate(House, into = c("Village","Position"), sep = "_") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "Position", values_from = "BC") %>% 
  group_by(Village, hour, activity) %>% 
  summarise(meanIN = mean(Indoor, na.rm=TRUE),
            meanOUT = mean(Outdoor, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(.,aes(x = meanIN, y = meanOUT, group = Village, color = activity))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_grid(~Village)


```


### BC Concentration Timeline
```{r echo=FALSE}
HH_3 %>% 
  ggplot(.,aes(x = date, y = BC, group = House, color = House))+
  geom_point(size = 0.5)+
  #facet_wrap(~House, ncol = 1)+
  theme_pubr()




```


**Notes:**
* Challenges identified for in-situ measurement as BC concentration can go high
* Data Filtered:
  - Bad data points: instrument choked due to severe concentration levels
  - IQR Criteria utilized for **Outlier removal** (1.5 times Q1 and Q3)
* Concurrent measurements were limited


### Diurnal Concentration Profile of BC

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plotTV_BC = HH_3 %>% timeVariation(pollutant = "BC")
plot(plotTV_BC, subset="hour")
```


**Notes:**
* 5 min BC -> Hourly average 
* Effect of emission
  - Cooking source during morning and evening period enhanced pollutant concentration
  - Post cooking decay of pollutant
* Effect of Atmosphere
  - PBL height reduced BC concentration


### BC concentration by activity period
```{r echo=FALSE}
HH_3 %>% ggplot(.,aes(x = activity, y = BC))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme_pubr()
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
meanBC = HH_3 %>% group_by(activity) %>% 
  summarise(meanBC = mean(BC),
            meanBCbb = mean(BCbb),
            meanBCff = mean(BCff)) %>% 
  ungroup()

meanBC %>% 
  mutate(pctChBC = (meanBC - last(meanBC))/last(meanBC)*100,
         pctChBCbb = (meanBCbb - last(meanBCbb))/last(meanBCbb)*100,
         pctChBCff = (meanBCff - last(meanBCff))/last(meanBCff)*100) %>% 
  filter(activity != "NoCook") %>% 
    kable(digits = 2) %>% 
  kable_styling()


```


**Notes:**
* percentage change in all BC components are same!


### BC Apportionment Results

```{r echo=FALSE}

  select(House, activity, BC, BCbb, BCff,BB) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(BC,BCbb,BCff,BB), names_to = "parameter",values_to = "values") %>%
  ggplot(.,aes(x = values))+
  geom_histogram(fill="#FF6666",colour="black")+
  facet_grid(activity~parameter, scales = "free")+
  theme_pubr()
  
```



**Notes:**
* BB distribution remains almost similar centering 94.16%



```{r echo=FALSE}
HH_3 %>% 
  select(House, DayPart, BC, BCbb, BCff,BB) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(BC,BCbb,BCff,BB), names_to = "parameter",values_to = "values") %>%
  ggplot(.,aes(x = values))+
  geom_histogram(fill="#FF6666",colour="black")+
  facet_grid(DayPart~parameter, scales = "free")+
  theme_pubr()
  
```


**Notes:**
* No visible change in BB/FF separation during parts of day


### AAE

```{r echo=FALSE}

HH_3 %>% 
  ggplot(.,aes(x = House, y = AAE_Blue_IR, fill = activity))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme_classic()

```


**Notes:**
* Negative AAE values observed

### Indoor - Outdoor
```{r echo=FALSE}
HH_3 %>% 
  separate(House, into = c("Village","Position"), sep = "_") %>% 
  group_by(activity, Position) %>% 
  summarise(AAE = mean(AAE_Blue_IR),
            BC = mean(BC),
            BCbb = mean(BCbb)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "Position", values_from = c("AAE","BC","BCbb")) %>%
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(AAE_pctCh = 100*(AAE_Indoor - AAE_Outdoor)/AAE_Outdoor,
         BC_pctCh = 100*(BC_Indoor - BC_Outdoor)/BC_Outdoor,
         BCbb_pctCh = 100*(BCbb_Indoor - BCbb_Outdoor)/BCbb_Outdoor) %>% 
  select(activity, AAE_Indoor, AAE_Outdoor, AAE_pctCh,BC_pctCh,BCbb_pctCh) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2) %>% 
  kable_styling()
  
```


**Notes:**
* BC concentration during morning cooking increased by 12% (highest observed)
* During **NoCook** period BC concentration lowered by 4.6% than the outdoor -> infiltration process
* AAE increased by 10.34% during Morning Cooking session -> Use of SBF can be confirmed
* Percentage change in BCbb was not dominant - issue with SA fraction. 



### BC concentration by Location~Activity
```{r echo=FALSE}
HH_3 %>% ggplot(.,aes(x = activity, y = BC, fill = House))+
